          About Me
        </h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            From a young age, I grew up using computers. I became interested in
            how different applications and programs worked. This curiosity
            blossomed into an interest in software development and engineering. I
            majored in computer science and learned about the theory and the
            Agile development cycle. I fell in love with the entire development
            process, from requirement gathering to user deployment. I faced each
            new challenge with a positive and inquisitive mind which allowed me to overcome
            many hurdles in my software development journey.
